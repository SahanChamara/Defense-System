# Defense System Simulation Project

## Overview
This is a Defense System Simulation built entirely in Java using Swing, demonstrating my ability to create a complex, interactive game environment without relying on a game engine. The project showcases the use of object-oriented programming (OOP) principles and the observer design pattern to build a modular and scalable defense system simulation.

## Key Features
- ⚙️ **Deployment and Control of Diverse War Units**: Includes Helicopters, Tanks, Submarines, and more.
- 🛠 **Java Swing UI**: Designed entirely using Java Swing for a seamless user experience.
- 🎯 **Object-Oriented Design**: Built with strong OOP principles, ensuring modularity and scalability.
- 🔄 **Observer Design Pattern**: Used for managing state changes and real-time updates in the simulation.

## Technologies Used
- **Java**: The core language used to build the simulation.
- **Swing**: Java’s graphical user interface toolkit used to design the user interface.
- **OOP Principles**: Applied throughout the project for better modularity, maintainability, and scalability.
- **Observer Design Pattern**: Used for managing state changes and real-time updates in the simulation.
